# Purpose
 For math exploration paper IB Math SL2 Block 3

# Explanation of main.py
 main.py is used as the data analyzer, it takes in raw historical data and outputs
 parsed and 7-day average data, seen in their respective folders.

# Replication of data analysis
 main.py requires the 'csv' and 'os' library to be used, as a result, a windows os is required
 references to file directory must be changed to match local client
 historical files must also be put in designated places, recreatability can be arranged
 
# Use of visualGraph.py
 visualGraph requires the 'pandas' and 'plotly.express' libraries to function, after correct
 installtion, running the python file will allow to user to query and retrieve different graphs of the data
 (7 day moving average), (raw)

# Step by step replication
 1. Install python version 3+
 2. Open command prompt
 3. Run 'pip install plotly' and 'pip install pandas'
 4. Clone the testing branch, and extract to a folder
 5. Run main.py by double clicking to parse and process data
 6. Run visaulGraph.py by double clicking to recieve interactive graphs
